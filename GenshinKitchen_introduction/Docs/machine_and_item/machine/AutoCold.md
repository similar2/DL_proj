在切割机上，可以自动对食材进行**加工**操作。
自动意味着你只需要交互一次，就可以等待加工完成。

On the cutting machine, you can automatically **process** food ingredients. Automatic means that you only need to interact once and then wait for the processing to be completed.

|Operation|Description|
|--------|-------------------------------|
|Put     | If there are no food ingredients on the cutting machine, you can place the food you have in your hands on the cutting machine, otherwise it is **illegal.**. |
|Get     | If there are ingredients on the stone mill, take them in your hand, otherwise it's **illegal.**. |
|Interact| After one interaction (no need to keep it), the cutting machine will continue processing the food ingredients. During this time, as long as you do not take out the ingredients prematurely, you will not lose the processing progress. |
|Throw   | **Illegal operation.** |
