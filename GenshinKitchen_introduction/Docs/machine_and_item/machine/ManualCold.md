在石磨上，你可以手动对食材进行**加工**操作。
手动意味着你需要持续交互，直到加工完成为止。

Here you can manually **process** food ingredients, which means you must continue interacting until the processing is complete.

|Operation|Description|
|--------|-------------------------------|
|Put     | If there are no food ingredients on the stone mill, you can place the food you have in your hands on the stone mill, otherwise it is **illegal.**. |
|Get     | If there are ingredients on the stone mill, take them in your hand, otherwise it's **illegal.**. |
|Interact| Maintain the Interact status continuously to process the food ingredients on the stone mill. Stopping the interaction prematurely will result in the loss of all processing progress. There will be no response when interacting with the stone mill if there are no food ingredients on it. |
|Throw   | **Illegal operation.** |
