# Workbench 工作盆
*歆羡生灵的形体，「纯水」能化作林野百态，就用这「水」惩罚你吧...*

在工作盆上，你可以手动对食材进行**组合**操作。
手动意味着你需要持续交互，直到加工完成为止。

Here you can manually **combine** food ingredients, which means you must continue interacting until the processing is complete.

|Operation|Description|
|--------|-------------------------------|
|Put     | If the workbench is not full, place the food you have in your hands on the workbench; otherwise, it is **illegal**. |
|Get     | If there are ingredients on the workbench, take them in your hand, otherwise it's **illegal.**. |
|Interact| Maintain the Interact status continuously to combine the food ingredients in the workbench. Stopping the interaction prematurely will result in the loss of all processing progress. There will be no response when interacting with the workbench if there are no food ingredients in it. |
|Throw   | **Illegal operation.** |
